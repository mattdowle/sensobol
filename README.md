# sensobol

The goal of `sensobol` is to provide a set of functions to swiftly compute and visualize Sobol' sensitivity indices. The functions allow to: 
- Create the sample matrices for the model evaluation.
- Compute and bootstrap up to third-order effects.
- Assess the approximation error of Sobol' indices.
- Plot the model uncertainty and the Sobol' indices.

## Installation

You can install the released version of sensobol as follows:

``` r
install.packages("devtools") # if you have not installed devtools package already
devtools::install_github("arnaldpuy/sensobol", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
