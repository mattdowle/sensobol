# sensobol (0.1.1)

This is a small patch release fixing bugs discovered in the previous release (0.1.0).

It also fixes the following check errors on CRAN:
  - Namespace in Imports field not imported from: ‘parallel’.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.2
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

### Notes

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    * Indices (2:48)
    * Khorashadi (13:22)
    * Saltelli (11:29)
    * Sobol (2:29, 10:81, 14:61)
    * Zadeh (13:33)
    * al (11:41, 13:42)
    * et (11:38, 13:39)
    * indices (10:88, 15:11)

The mispelled words, which I have checked, are correct.
