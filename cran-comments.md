The note is as follows:

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    Indices (2:48)
    Khorashadi (13:22)
    Saltelli (11:29)
    Sobol (2:29, 10:81, 14:61)
    Zadeh (13:33)
    al (11:41, 13:42)
    et (11:38, 13:39)
    indices (10:88, 15:11)

The mispelled words, which I have checked, are actually correct.



* This is a new release.
